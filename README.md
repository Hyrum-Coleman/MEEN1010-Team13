## Project Description
This project uses Matlab to find the location of holes in an acrylic plate using vision software, and then sends the location information to an Arduino Romeo board which controls a robot to launch ping pong balls into the holes.  
  
The repository contains the following files/folders:
* `README.md` - This file
* `TestHardwareSketch` - Arduino sketch for testing the Romeo board
* `Demo2` - Matlab code for making sure the robot is properly calibrated
* `Demo3` - Matlab code for finding the holes in the plate
* `Final Code` - Matlab code for finding the holes in the plate and sending the location information to the Romeo board

## How to Run
1. Open the `Final Code` folder
2. Open `Demo4.m` in Matlab
3. Connect the Romeo board to the computer
4. Run the Matlab code
